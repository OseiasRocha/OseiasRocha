- 👋 Hi, I’m @OseiasRocha
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded software development, operating systems and networking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning FreeRTOS, VxWorks, Linux, and Qt.
- 🌱 Next things to learn in my list are:
  - Rust
  - C#
  - Kotlin
  - Flutter and Dart
  - Some game engine (Unreal, Unity, etc). This one is just for fun :smiley:
- I work with C, C++, Python and a little bit of Lua. There's always something new on them, so I never stop learning :smiley:
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on embedded software projects or kernel and OS.
